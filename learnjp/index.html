            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>This is a concise guide on how to read (VNs, LNs, manga etc.) in Japanese. For something more comprehensive see <a href="https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/">Kuri's guide</a> and/or <a href="https://learnjapanese.moe/">Shoui's guide</a>. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me on Discord (username: nullsp_ce)</p>

            
            <h1>Foundation</h1>
            <h2>Kana</h2>
            <p>Hiragana and Katakana are the 2 basic "alphabets" used in Japanese. You can learn them <a href="https://vedxyz.github.io/kana/">here</a>.</p>

            <h2>Basic Vocabulary</h2>
            <p>Memorise ~1000 common words. I recommend you do this with <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/donkuri/Kaishi/releases">Kaishi 1.5k</a> deck.</p>

            <h2>Basic Grammar</h2>
            <p>Read through one of these grammar guides (pick whichever you like the most, they teach the same content):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://gohoneko.neocities.org/learn/anon/sakubi">Sakubi Grammar Guide</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://gohoneko.neocities.org/grammar/taekim">Tae Kim's Grammar Guide</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://imabi.org/">IMABI</a></li>
            </ul>

            
            <h1>Core</h1>
            <h2>Yomitan Setup</h2>
            <p>The Yomitan browser extension [<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/yomitan/">Firefox</a>] [<a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/yomitan-popup-dictionary/likgccmbimhjbgkjambclfkhldnlhbnn?pli=1">Chrome</a>] will allow you to look up unknown words as you hover over them. The most important dictionaries you should install on it are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/stephenmk/Jitendex/releases/latest">Jitendex</a>: a JP-EN vocabulary dictionary</li>
                <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DRFhsmAr6wVs1SG9MRNvgkEvs6Yrpgig/view?usp=drive_link">Dictionary of Japanese Grammar</a>: a JP-EN grammar dictionary</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/Kuuuube/yomitan-dictionaries/raw/main/dictionaries/JPDB_v2.2_Frequency_Kana_2024-10-13.zip">JPDB Frequency v2.2</a>: a frequency dictionary</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Read</h2>
            <p>Mindset:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first thing you read will be <i>extremely</i> difficult, no matter what it is or how many words you've memorised so far. Vocabulary size and reading ability are not the same thing, so don't fall into the common trap of putting off reading by memorising more words instead. The only way to get better at reading is to read, and it will be <i>much</i> easier after you finish your first book.</li>
                <li>DO NOT use machine translation (Google Translate, DeepL, ChatGPT etc), even if you are stuck! It will most likely be wrong, unnatural or misleading.</li>
                <li>Enjoyment always takes priority over efficiency. If you have a choice between something that is easy but boring or something that is interesting but hard, choose the hard one.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The reading process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Look up every unknown word/grammar in the sentence with Yomitan. Try to memorise their meanings and readings.</li>
                <li>Try to understand what the sentence as a whole means. If you still can't figure it out after a little while, just move on.</li>
                <li>Move on to the next sentence and repeat.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>How to remember words:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Read more. After enough lookups, you will eventually remember the word.</li>
                <li>Consider any kanji used in the word, and whether they share patterns with other words or other kanji you already know. Connecting new ideas to what you already know makes it much easier to learn and remember.</li>
                <li>Create an Anki card for the word and memorise it there.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Read!</h2>
            <p>Read whatever you like!</p> 
            <p>You can read manga (with Yomitan-able HTML text) at <a href="https://catalog.mokuro.moe/">Mokuro</a>.</p>
            <p>You can read light novels (as EPUB or HTMLZ files) with <a href="https://reader.ttsu.app">ッツ Reader</a>.</p>
            <p>For visual novels, you can extract text to your browser with <a href="https://github.com/Artikash/Textractor/releases">Textractor</a> (or <a href="https://github.com/0xDC00/agent">Agent</a>), a clipboard inserter [<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lap-clipboard-inserter/">Firefox</a>] [<a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/clipboard-inserter/deahejllghicakhplliloeheabddjajm">Chrome</a>] and a <a href="https://kuuuube.github.io/texthooker/index.html">texthooking page</a>.</p>
            <p>If you're unsure on what to read, I'd suggest <a href="https://tsukiweb.holofield.fr/title">月姫 (Tsukihime)</a> as an easy visual novel that you can read for free in your browser. You can change the language to Japanese via Config > Advanced > Language > 日本語.</p>
            <p>For more recommendations, see <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w42HEKEu2AzZg9K7PI0ma9ICmr2qYEKQ9IF4XxFSnQU/edit?gid=1999205540#gid=1999205540">Kuri's recommendation sheet</a>. Anything rated Medium or below is suitable for your first read (even Medium-Hard would be tough but doable).</p>
