            <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
            <p>This is a concise guide on how to read (VNs, LNs, manga etc.) in Japanese. For something more comprehensive see <a href="https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/">Kuri's guide</a> and/or <a href="https://learnjapanese.moe/">Shoui's guide</a>. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me on Discord (username: nullsp_ce).</p>

            
            <h1 id="foundation">Foundation</h1>
            <h2 id="kana">Kana</h2>
            <p>Hiragana and Katakana are the 2 basic "alphabets" used in Japanese. You can learn them <a href="https://vedxyz.github.io/kana/">here</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="kanji">Kanji</h2>
            <p>Kanji is another writing system used in Japanese. ~3000 characters are regularly used, and each kanji represents a meaning. However, the pronunciation ("reading") of a kanji changes depending on the word it is used in. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>一 (いち) "one"</li>
                <li>一つ (ひとつ) "one thing"</li>
                <li>日 (ひ) "day" or "sun"</li>
                <li>一日 (いちにち) "one day"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Unlike kana, it doesn't make sense to learn kanji or their readings in isolation. Learn words.</p>
            
            <h2 id="vocab">Basic Vocabulary</h2>
            <p>Memorise ~1000 common words. I recommend you do this with <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/donkuri/Kaishi/releases">Kaishi 1.5k</a> deck. You can learn how to use Anki with the <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/studying.html">Anki Manual</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="grammar">Basic Grammar</h2>
            <p>Read through one of these grammar guides (pick whichever you like the most, they teach the same content):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://sakubi.neocities.org/">Sakubi Grammar Guide</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://gohoneko.neocities.org/grammar/taekim">Tae Kim's Grammar Guide</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://djtguide.github.io/grammar/imabi.html">IMABI</a></li>
            </ul>

            
            <h1 id="core">Core</h1>
            <h2 id="yomitan">Yomitan Setup</h2>
            <p>The <a href="https://yomitan.wiki/getting-started/">Yomitan</a> browser extension will allow you to look up unknown words as you hover over them. The most important dictionaries you should install on it are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/stephenmk/Jitendex/releases/latest">Jitendex</a> for vocabulary</li>
                <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DRFhsmAr6wVs1SG9MRNvgkEvs6Yrpgig/view?usp=drive_link">Dictionary of Japanese Grammar</a> for grammar</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/Kuuuube/yomitan-dictionaries/raw/main/dictionaries/JPDB_v2.2_Frequency_Kana_2024-10-13.zip">JPDB Frequency v2.2</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>To make sure results are sorted properly, go to Yomitan settings > Dictionaries and set "Frequency sorting dictionary" to JPDBv2.</p>

            <h2 id="howtoread">How to Read</h2>
            <p id="mindset">Mindset:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first thing you read will be <i>extremely</i> difficult, no matter what it is or how many words you've memorised. Vocabulary size and reading ability are not the same thing, so don't fall into the common trap of putting off reading by memorising more words instead. The only way to get better at reading is to read, and it will be <i>much</i> easier after you finish your first book.</li>
                <li>DO NOT use machine translation (Google Translate, DeepL, ChatGPT etc), even if you are stuck! It will most likely be wrong, unnatural or misleading.</li>
                <li>Enjoyment always takes priority over efficiency. If you have a choice between something that is easy but boring or something that is interesting but hard, choose the hard one.</li>
            </ul>

            <p id="process">The reading process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Look up every unknown word/grammar in the sentence with Yomitan. Try to memorise their meanings and readings.</li>
                <li>Try to understand what the sentence as a whole means. If you still can't figure it out after a little while, just move on.</li>
                <li>Move on to the next sentence and repeat.</li>
            </ul>

            <p id="memory">How to remember words:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Read more. After enough lookups, you will eventually remember the word.</li>
                <li>If the word contains unknown kanji, break them down into their components and see if you can relate their meaning to the main kanji with logic, association or a mnemonic. For example, 栞 ("bookmark") is composed of 干 ("dry") and 木 ("tree").</li>
                <li>If the word has multiple kanji, evaluate the relationship between them. For example, the word 説明 ("explanation") has the kanji 説 ("theory") and 明 ("brightness"). In this case, you could interpret 明 as describing a clarity or insight towards 説, resulting in the meaning of 説明.</li>
                <li>Optionally, you can make Anki cards for words you struggle to remember.</li>
            </ul>

            <p id="readmore">How to spend more time reading:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make reading into a small habit (e.g. 10 minutes every morning) then slowly increase it over time.</li>
                <li>Use a <a href="https://pomofocus.io/">pomodoro timer</a> to maintain focus. If you want, you can change the default time ratio of 25/5 to something else like 45/15.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="read">Read!</h2>
            <p>Read whatever you like!</p> 
            <p>You can read manga (with Yomitan-able HTML text) at <a href="https://catalog.mokuro.moe/">Mokuro</a>.</p>
            <p>You can read light novels (as EPUB or HTMLZ files) with <a href="https://reader.ttsu.app">ッツ Reader</a>.</p>
            <p>For visual novels, you can extract text to your browser with <a href="https://github.com/Artikash/Textractor/releases">Textractor</a> (or <a href="https://github.com/0xDC00/agent">Agent</a>), a clipboard inserter [<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lap-clipboard-inserter/">Firefox</a>] [<a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/clipboard-inserter/deahejllghicakhplliloeheabddjajm">Chrome</a>] and a <a href="https://kuuuube.github.io/texthooker/index.html">texthooking page</a>.</p>
            <p>If you're unsure on what to read, I'd suggest <a href="https://tsukiweb.holofield.fr/title">月姫 (Tsukihime)</a> as an easy visual novel that you can read for free in your browser. You can change the language to Japanese via Config > Advanced > Language > 日本語.</p>
            <p>For more recommendations, see <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w42HEKEu2AzZg9K7PI0ma9ICmr2qYEKQ9IF4XxFSnQU/edit?gid=1999205540#gid=1999205540">Kuri's recommendation sheet</a>. Anything rated Medium or below is suitable for your first read.</p>

            <h2 id="extrayomitan">Further Yomitan Setup</h2>
            <p>There are many monolingual (JP-JP) dictionaries available for Yomitan. These provide more accurate definitions and larger coverage of unknown words. I use the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/MarvNC/yomitan-dictionaries?tab=readme-ov-file#%E6%BC%A2%E6%A4%9C%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%97%E8%BE%9E%E5%85%B8%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E7%89%88-kanken-kanji-jiten-2nd-edition">漢検漢字辞典　第二版</a> for concise vocab definitions and kanji information</li>
                <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/169tv6bKqqGuv8Y5Wj9f8SpP3IGxYZUKD/view?usp=drive_link">三省堂</a> for easy definitions</li>
